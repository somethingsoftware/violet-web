Signed hosting for trusted blog surfing

In a world filled with AI slop, we're missing a platform that's willing or
capable of trustworthy hosting of information.
It's hard to say anyone can do it perfectly, but we'd like to take a swing

Asymmetric keys can be used to verify the signature
of blog posts by individual authors.

Authors can self-report AI content or AI-assisted content.

We can chose who we trust without attention-grabbing,
traumatizing suggestion algorithms. We did it for thousands
and thousands of years before computers even came around.

## Goals

* Cryptographically enforced self-governed suggestions
* AI authorship detection
* Invite based peer identity verification
* Reputation based on self and invitee's authenticity

## Explicit Non-Goals

* Hosting media (audio, video, large data dumps)
* Targeted advertising
* Non-human entities (extraterrestrial beings and corporations / groups)
* Humans worth more than the average human's weight in gold
