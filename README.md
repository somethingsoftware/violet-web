Signed hosting for trusted blog surfing

In a world filled with AI slop, we're missing a platform that's willing or capable of trustworthy hosting of information.
It's hard to say anyone can do it perfectly, but we'd like to take a swing

Asymmetric keys can be used to verify the signature of blog posts by individual authors.

Authors can self-report AI content or AI-assisted content.

We can chose who we trust without attention-grabbing, traumatizing suggestion algorithms, we did it for thousands
and thousands of years before computers even came around.
